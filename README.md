  <h1>Users System🧑‍💻</h1>

  <p>
    I developed this project with help of a course in youtube. 
    In this project I learned the <b>spring boot fundamentals, spring security, hash passwords, users management, connect a db MySQL and some of hibernate.</b>
    Project was very important for me, because it was very challenging and very funny.

    The project is a template that I downloaded from google and I added backend functionalities to it.
    Through a login or register screen, an user enters his or her data and is registered in the database.
    When the user is logged, he can see the users saved in the database.
    The project is simple, but I have learned a lot.
